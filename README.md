# Digital Forensics: Image Analysis Using Autopsy

## Description  
This project demonstrates **digital forensic analysis** of a forensic disk image using **Autopsy**, an open-source tool for extracting digital evidence. The analysis aims to uncover hidden or deleted data, track user activity, and identify potential security incidents. This repository highlights key forensic steps and the use of Autopsy for evidence extraction.

## Key Steps & Findings:
1. ****Forensic Image Analysi**: Loaded the disk image into Autopsy to begin the examination.
2. **Evidence Recovery**: Recovered deleted files, metadata, and system logs.
3. **User Activity Tracking**: Investigated registry entries, system logs, and browsing history to trace user behavior.
4. **Network Analysis**: Analyzed network logs to identify suspicious activity.
5. **Timeline Reconstruction**: Correlated file timestamps and system logs to track events.

## Tools & Techniques:
- **Autopsy**: Used for analyzing disk images and extracting forensic evidence.
- **Linux Commands**: Utilized commands like `strings`, `grep`, and `foremost` to extract raw data.
- **Hex Editors**: Used to manually inspect file structures and raw data.

## Objective  
The objective of this project is to showcase the use of Autopsy for **digital forensics** and provide insights into the analysis of disk images. The project focuses on extracting and analyzing data, with all evidence and artifacts being created or modified for demonstration purposes.
